# A Sinclair ZX81 and ZX80 Emulator for the Raspberry Pi Pico
## Summary
+ Runs on the [Pimoroni Pico VGA demo board](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-vga-demo-base),
the [Pimoroni Pico DVI demo board (HDMI)](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-dv-demo-base), the [PicoMite VGA board](https://geoffg.net/picomitevga.html) and the [Olimex RP2040-PICO-PC](https://www.olimex.com/Products/MicroPython/RP2040-PICO-PC/open-source-hardware)
+ Supports sound over onboard DAC or PWM when available in hardware
+ Provides an immersive full screen experience, with a very fast boot time and no operating system
+ Simultaneous USB keyboard and joystick support (using a powered USB hub)
+ The small form factor makes the board easy to mount in period or reproduction cases. The low cost, relatively low performance and software generated display of the Pico is a 21st century analogue for the ZX80 and ZX81
+ Emulates pseudo and Hi-res graphics
+ Emulates ZonX and Quicksilva sound
+ Emulates QS User Defined Graphics
+ Emulation runs at accurate speed of a 3.25MHz ZX81
+ Emulates 50Hz and 60Hz display
+ Support for up to 320 by 240 pixel display i.e. 40 character width and 30 character height
+ Load `.p`, `.81`, `.o` and `.80` files from micro SD Card. Save `.p` and `.o` files
+ Supports loading and saving of memory blocks using [ZXpand like syntax](https://github.com/charlierobson/ZXpand-Vitamins/wiki/ZXpand---Online-Manual#load)
+ Set-up of emulator (computer type, RAM, Hi-Res graphics, sound, joystick control etc) configurable on a per program basis, using config files
+ Optionally displays graphic of keyboard (taken from [sz81](https://github.com/SegHaxx/sz81)). Can type in code with keyboard visible
+ Can be extended for other board types. Code support included for a custom VGA RGB 332 board similar to that supported by [MCUME](https://github.com/Jean-MarcHarvengt/MCUME)

## Notes
+ The intention of the emulator is to provide an authentic '80s feel. There have been amazing ZX81 developments in recent years, such as ([Chroma 81](http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/ZX81/Chroma/ChromaInterface.htm), [ZXpand+](https://www.rwapsoftware.co.uk/zx812.html) etc). These are not supported. Instead it emulates the hardware that was advertised in the early '80s i.e. QS UDG, Sound, joystick, hi-res mono graphics. However, basic support to load and save memory blocks, using a syntax similar to ZXpand is implemented
+ The ["Big Bang"](https://www.sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?t=2986) ROM is supported, as this accelerates BASIC execution, and runs on the original ZX81 hardware
+ Program debug support is limited to that provided by the ZX81 "in period", i.e. non-existent. It is recommended that one of the PC or Linux based ZX81 emulators with single step and breakpoint support are used to debug Z80 assembly programs
+ To achieve a full speed emulation the Pico is overclocked to 250MHz. There is a very slight risk that this may damage the Pico. However many other applications run the Pico at this frequency. By default the stock voltage is used (1.1V), this has been successfully tested on multiple Picos. If the emulator appears unstable it can be built to use 1.2V, add `-DOVER_CLOCK` to the cmake command
+ The Pico only has 1 USB port. The Pimoroni and Olimex boards can be powered through a second on board USB power connector, allowing a keyboard to be connected to the Pico using an OTG adaptor
+ To connect more than one peripheral (e.g. a keyboard and joystick) at the same time, a powered USB OTG hub is required. These 3 hubs have been successfully tested. [1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B083WML1XB), [2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B078M3Z84Z), [3](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Z4RHJ2D). Plug the hub directly into the USB port on the Pico, not the USB power connector on the Pimoroni board  
**Note:** Testing has shown that all of these hubs can support OTG and power delivery to the Pico simultaneously
+ On rare occasion, some USB keyboards and joysticks fail to be detected when connected via powered hubs. A re-boot of the Pico often results in successful detection
+ The PicoMite VGA board has a PS/2 keyboard socket. Currently this is not supported, a USB keyboard must be used
+ The Olimex RP2040-PICO-PC has a stereo audio jack. ~~but the left channel cannot be used with HDMI, so only mono audio through the right channel is possible when using this board~~ The emulator now supports stereo sound on this board
+ In an ideal world the latest versions of the excellent sz81 or EightyOne emulators would have been ported. An initial port showed that they are too processor intensive for an (overclocked) ARM M0+. An earlier version of sz81 ([2.1.8](https://github.com/ikjordan/sz81_2_1_8)) was used as a basis, with some Z80 timing corrections and back porting of the 207 tstate counter code from the latest sz81 (2.3.12). See [here](#applications-tested) for a list of applications tested

# Building
**Notes:**
+ Prebuilt executable files for the 5 supported board types can be found [here](uf2/)
+ If a **zip** of the source files is downloaded from GitHub, it will be **incomplete**, as the zip will not contain the submodules. Zip files of the submodules would have to be downloaded separately from GitHub. It is easier to clone recursive the repository, as described in the following section

### To build:
1. Install the Raspberry Pi Pico toolchain and SDK

    Instructions to do this for several operating systems can be found by downloading [this pdf](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf). Chapter 2 covers installation on the Raspberry Pi, chapter 9 describes the process for other operating systems
2. The vga display uses the `pico_scanvideo` library, which is part of the `pico-extras` repository. Clone this repository, including submodules

    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras.git`

3. Clone this repository (i.e. picozx81), including submodules

    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ikjordan/picozx81.git`
4. create a build directory, move to that directory and build using CMake. By default an executable compatible with the Pimoroni vga board will be created.
This will be named `picozx81_vga.uf2`

    `mkdir build`  
    `cd build`  
    `cmake ..`  
    `make`
5. To build for other boards, pass the board type as part of the cmake command. e.g.

| Board | CMake | uf2 name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pimoroni DVI |`cmake -DPICO_BOARD=dviboard ..` | `picozx81_dvi.uf2`|
| PicoMite VGA |`cmake -DPICO_BOARD=picomitevgaboard ..` | `picozx81_picomitevga.uf2`|
| Olimex PICO DVI |`cmake -DPICO_BOARD=olimexpcboard ..` | `picozx81_olimexpc.uf2`|
| Pimoroni VGA |`cmake -DPICO_BOARD=vgaboard ..` | `picozx81_vga.uf2`|
| Custom 332 VGA|`cmake -DPICO_BOARD=vga332board ..`| `picozx81_vga332.uf2`|

**Note:** The [`buildall`](buildall) script in the root directory of `picozx81` will build `uf2` files for all supported board types


6. Upload the `uf2` file to the pico
7. Populate a micro SD Card with files you wish to run. Optionally add `config.ini` files to the SD Card. See [here](examples) for examples of config files

# Use
## Quick Start
+ If the emulator is started with no SD Card, or with an empty SD Card, then it will emulate a 16K ZX81
+ To switch to always starting emulating a ZX80, a populated SD Card is required. If it is present, the machine that is emulated is specified by the `config.ini` file in the root directory, see [configuring the emulator](#configuring-the-emulator)
+ If the contents of the [examples](examples) directory have been copied to the SD Card, then the included programs can be loaded. Press `F2` to see files in the current directory that can be loaded
+ To make picozx81 emulate a ZX80, without changing `config.ini`, a ZX80 program can be loaded. Press `F2`, navigate up one directory and then select the `ZX80` directory. Select `simple.o` and load it. The emulator will now be in ZX80 mode, with a simple 1 line ZX80 BASIC program loaded
+ The current settings used by the emulator can be viewed by pressing `F3`
+ The following sections describe how to configure the emulator and provide links to programs that can be downloaded, copied to the SD Card and then run using the emulator

## Configuring the Emulator
### Main Attributes
The following can be configured:
| Item | Description | Default Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Computer | Selects either ZX81, ZX81x2 or ZX80 | ZX81 | ZX80 assumes 4kB ROM. ZX81x2 selects a ZX81 with the ["Big Bang"](https://www.sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?t=2986) ROM for faster BASIC |
| Memory | In kB. Starting at 0x4000 | 16 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 32 and 48 allowed |
| WRX | Selects if RAM supports Hi-res graphics | Off | Automatically set to on if Memory is 2kB or less |
| LowRAM | Selects if RAM populated between 0x2000 and 0x3fff| Off | Typically used in conjunction with WRX to create a hires display file in low memory, can also be used for UDG graphics emulation if WRX off|
| M1NOT | Allows machine code to be executed between 0x8000 and 0xbfff| Off |Memory must be set to 32 or 48   |
| ExtendFile| Enables the loading and saving of memory blocks for the ZX81, using ZXpand+ syntax|Off| See [Loading and Saving Memory Blocks](#loading-and-saving-memory-blocks)|
| NTSC | Enables emulation of NTSC (60Hz display refresh)| Off | As for the "real" ZX81, SLOW mode is slower when NTSC is selected|
| VTOL | Specifies the tolerance in lines of the emulated TV display detecting vertical sync| 100 | See notes below|
| Centre | When enabled the usual 32 by 24 character display is centred on screen| On | Set to OFF for some programs that require the full 320 by 240 pixel display (e.g. [QS Defenda](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/QSDefenda) or [MaxDemo](https://bodo4all.fortunecity.ws/zx/maxdemo.html))|
| QSUDG | Enables emulation of the QS user defined graphics board| Off |Memory automatically limited to 16 when selected   |
| Sound | Selects sound card (if any) | Off | Quicksilva and ZonX supported |
| ACB | Enables ACB stereo if sound card enabled | Off |  |

**Notes:**
1. The "real" QS UDG board had a manual switch to enable / disable. In the emulator, if UDG is selected, it is assumed to be switched on after the first write to the memory mapped address range (0x8400  to 0x87ff)
2. To emulate other UDG graphics cards that reside between 0x2000 and 0x3fff set LowRAM to On and WRX to Off. This setting is needed to run e.g. [Galaxians with user defined graphics](https://sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4388)
3. If `NTSC` is set to On and `Centre` is set to Off then a black vsync bar will be seen at the bottom of the display for programs that generate a typical 192 line display
4. A higher tolerance value results in faster screen stabilisation. As for a real TV, a low tolerance level results in vertical sync being lost for some programs, such as [QS Defenda](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/QSDefenda) and [Nova2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20170309171559/http://www.user.dccnet.com/wrigter/index_files/NOVA2005.p). The default value of 100 emulates a TV that very quickly regains vertical lock. Set the value to 15 to emulate a TV that struggles to maintain vertical lock. Run the [Flicker program](examples/ZX81/flicker.p) to see the effects of PAUSE on lock
5. The "Big Bang" ROM can double the speed of BASIC programs
### Joystick
In addition a USB joystick can be configured to generated key presses

| Item | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Left | Keypress when joystick moved left | 5 |
| Right | Keypress when joystick moved right | 8 |
| Up | Keypress when joystick moved up | 7 |
| Down | Keypress when joystick moved down | 6 |
| Button | Keypress when joystick button pressed | 0 |

Notes: ENTER and SPACE can be used to represent the New Line and Space keys, respectively

## Configuration Files
The items specified above are set via `config.ini` files. When a program is loaded the emulation configuration is read, and set for the program before it is run.
The order for configuring an item for a given program (e.g. `prog.p`) is as follows:
1. Search for `config.ini` in the directory that contains `prog.p`
2. If it exists, configure items specified in a `[prog.p]` section
3. If it exists, configure items not yet specified, that exist in a `[default]` section
4. Search for `config.ini` in the root directory
5. If it exists, configure items not yet specified, that exist in a `[default]` section
6. Configure any items not yet specified with the default values given above

**Note:** All entries in a `config.ini` file are case insensitive

### Extra configuration options
Two extra options can be set via the `[default]` section of the `config.ini` file in the root directory
| Item | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dir | Sets the initial default directory to load and save programs | / |
| Load | Specifies the name of a program to load automatically on boot in the directory given by `Dir` | "" |
| DoubleShift | Enables the generation of function key presses on a 40 key ZX80 or ZX81 keyboard. See [here](#function-key-menu)| Off |
| AllFiles| When set, all files are initially displayed when the [Load Menu](#f2---load-menu) is selected. When off only files with extensions `.p`, `.o`, `.81` and `.80` are initially displayed|Off|


### Examples
Examples of the `config.ini` files used to test the programs listed in this [section](#applications-tested) can be found [here](examples)
### Editing `config.ini`
The `config.ini` file *cannot* be edited within the emulator. Modify the `config.ini` file using another computer
### Need for reset
The emulator is always reset if any of the following options are changed:
+ Computer
+ Memory
+ LowRAM
+ M1NOT
+ WRX
+ QSUDG

**Note:** Changing the virtual sound card, or the video display settings, does *not* trigger a reset
## File Storage
Program and configuration files are stored on a micro SD-Card. Directories are supported. File and directory names should only contain characters that exist in the ZX81 character set. File and directory names can be a mixture of upper and lower case, but are used case insensitive. Therefore, all file and child directory names in a given directory must differ by more than just case
## Function key menu
The emulator has several menus that can be selected through function key presses. To keep the look and feel of the ZX8x computers the menus are in black and white and use the ZX81 font.

The original ZX80/ZX81 40 key keyboard does not have function keys. A "double shift" mechanism can be used instead. The mechanism is as follows:
1. Shift is pressed without another key
2. Shift is released, without another key being pressed
3. Within one second shift is pressed again
4. Shift is released, without another key being pressed
5. To generate a function key, within one second, a numeric key in the range `1` to `5` is pressed without shift being pressed. If `0` is pressed `Escape` is generated

To enable this mechanism set `DoubleShift` to `On` in the configuration file
### F1 - Reset
Hard resets the emulator. It is equivalent to removing and reconnecting the power
### F2 - Load Menu
A menu displaying directories and files that can be loaded is displayed, using the ZX81 font. Any sound that is playing is paused. Directory names are prepended by `<` and appended by `>` e.g. `<NAME>`

If the name of a file or directory is too long to display in full it is truncated with the last characters as `+` (file) and `+>` (directory)

+ The display can be navigated using the `up`, `down` and `enter` keys. The `7` key also generates `up` and the `6` key also generates `down`
+ For directories with a large number of files it is possible to move to the next page of files by using the `right`, `Page Down` or `8` key. To move to the previous page of files use the `left`, `Page Up` or `5` key
+ Press `A` to display all files in the directory. Press `P` to only display files with extensions `.p`, `.o`, `.81` and `.80`
+ Press `enter` whilst a directory entry is selected to move to that directory
+ Press `enter` when a file is selected to load that file
+ Press `Escape`, `space`, `Q` or `0` to return to the emulation without changing directory or loading a new program
### F3 - View Emulator Configuration
Displays the current emulator status. Any sound that is playing is paused. Note that this display is read only, no changes to the configuration can be made. Press `Escape`, `space`, `Q` or `0` to exit back to the running emulator
### F4 - Pause
Pauses the emulation. Handy if the phone rings during a gaming session! `P` is XORed into the 4 corners of the display to indicate that the emulator is paused. Press `Escape`, `space`, `Q` or `0` to end the pause and return to the running emulator
### F5 - Display Keyboard Overlay
The ZX80 and ZX81 use single key press BASIC entry. Pressing `F5` displays a 4 colour image (VGA) or a grey scale image (DVI / HDMI) representing the keyboard of the computer being emulated, so that the correct key presses can be determined. The image was taken from [sz81](https://github.com/SegHaxx/sz81). It is possible to enter commands whilst the keyboard is displayed

Press `Escape` to remove the keyboard display. The keyboard is also removed if another menu is selected

If a ZX8x 40 key keyboard is being used, then set `DoubleShift` to `On` and remove the menu by pressing and releasing shift twice and then pressing `0` within one second of releasing shift

## Loading and saving options
The emulator supports the loading  `.p`, `.81`, `.o` and `.80` files from micro SD Card. It can save in `.p` and `.o` format.
Files to be loaded should only contain characters that are in the ZX81 or ZX80 character set

### Load
There are 3 ways to load files:
#### 1. Via the F2 menu
The user can navigate the SD card directory and select a file to load. The emulator is configured to the settings specified for the file in the `config.ini` files, reset and the new file loaded
#### 2. Via `LOAD ""` (ZX81) or  `LOAD` (ZX80)
If the user enters the `LOAD` command without specifying a file name the SD Card directory menu is displayed and a file to load can be selected. The emulator is configured to the settings specified for the file in the `config.ini` files. Unlike for option 1, the emulator is only reset if the configuration differs. This, for example, allows for RAMTOP to be manually set before loading a program
#### 3. Via `LOAD "program-name"` (ZX81 only)
If a file name is specified, then `.p` is appended and an attempt is made to load the file from the current directory. The configuration for the file is read. A reset is performed only if required by a configuration change. This allows for multiple parts of an application to be loaded e.g. [HiRes Chess](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/32021/ZX81/Hi-res_Chess) or [QS games](#qs-udg-graphics) that include character definitions.

If the supplied filename, with `.p` appended, does not exist, then the `LOAD` fails with error `D`. This is similar to a "real" ZX81, where if a named file is not on a tape, the computer will attempt to load until the user aborts by pressing `BREAK`, generating error `D`

### Save
#### ZX81
To save a program the `SAVE "Filename"` command is used. If `"Filename"` has no extension then `.p` is appended to the supplied file name. The file is saved in the current directory. If a file of the specified name already exists, it is overwritten

#### ZX80
To save a program the `SAVE` command is used. It does not take a file name, so the program is saved in the current directory with the name `"zx80prog.o"`. If a file with that name already exists it is overwritten

### Loading and Saving Memory Blocks
The emulator supports extensions to `LOAD` and `SAVE` to support the loading and saving of memory blocks. The syntax is similar to that used by [ZXpand](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/charlierobson/ZXpand-Vitamins/wiki/ZXpand---Online-Manual).


**Note:** There are differences in failure modes and error reporting compared to the ZXpand. Also `.p` is *not* appended when loading and saving memory blocks

Set the `ExtendFile` config option to `On` to enable the extensions
#### Load
`LOAD "filename;nnnnn"`  
where `nnnnn` represents a decimal number specifying the target address

##### Failure Modes
+ Error inverse `1`: The target address is not a number, or is outside of the range 0 to 65535
+ Error inverse `3`: No data would be written into existent RAM. Checks are made to ensure that data is not written to ROM, or non existing RAM addresses
+ Error `D`: The specified filename does not exist (no `.p` extension is added)

**Note:**
+ The string passed to `LOAD` is parsed for target address if and only if it contains at least 1 `;` the target address is assumed to be after the last `;` in the string. If the string does not contain a `;` it is treated as a single filename and a program file is loaded with the name of the supplied string (with `.p` appended if there is no `.` in the supplied string)
#### Save
`SAVE "filename;sssss,lllll"`  
where:
+ `sssss` represents a decimal number specifying the start address of memory to be saved
+ `lllll` specifies the number of bytes of memory to be saved
##### Failure Modes
+ Error inverse `1`: The start address is not a number, or is outside of the range 0 to 65535
+ Error inverse `2`: The length address is not a number, or is outside of the range 1 to 65536
+ Error inverse `3`: The sum of the start address and the length is greater than 65536

**Notes:**
+ If a file with the specified name exists on the SD Card, it is overwritten
+ The string passed to `SAVE` is parsed for start and length if and only if it contains at least 1 `;` and a `,` exists in the string after the last `;`. Otherwise the string is treated as a single filename and a program file is saved with the name of the supplied string (with `.p` appended if there is no `.` in the supplied string)

### Directories
The original ZX81 used tape as a storage media, with no concept of a directory structure. The emulator uses an SD Card, and does support the basic use of directories.
#### Examples
+ `LOAD "../HIGHER"` will attempt to load the file `HIGHER.P` from the parent directory of the current directory
+ `LOAD "ABC/LOWER"` will attempt to load the file `LOWER.P` from the child directory with the name `ABC`
# Applications Tested
Testing the emulator has been a great way to experience some classic ZX81 games and demos, including many that stretch the ZX81 and ZX80 well beyond what Sinclair may have originally expected. The following have been successfully tested:
## ZX81
### Low res
+ [clkfreq / clckfreq](https://www.zx81.nl/files.html)
  + Runs in the right number of frames (1863) when NTSC not selected
+ [Artic Galaxians](https://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/Galaxians)
  + The one lo-res game that *had* to work correctly!
+ [ZXTEST2](https://sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=685&p=6120&hilit=zxtest.zip#p6120)
  + This creates an image that periodically moves up and down by 1 pixel on a real ZX81. The emulator replicates this behaviour
+ [Maxtxt](https://bodo4all.fortunecity.ws/zx/maxdemo.html)
  + Creates a 40 by 30 character display

### Pseudo Hi-res
+ [Celebration and Lightning Display Driver](http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/ZX81/NewSoftware/Celebration.htm)
+ [Z-Xtricator](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/Z-Xtricator)
  + For the bomb (aka "Super Zapper") effects to render correctly `WRX` must be set to Off (see [here](https://www.sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?p=46499#p46499))
+ [Rocket Man](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/RocketMan)
+ [War Web](http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/ZX81/Archive/PooterGames.htm)
+ [ZX81 Hires Invaders](https://www.perfectlynormalsite.com/hiresinvaders.html)
+ [High Resolution Invaders](http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/ZX81/Archive/OdysseyComputing.htm)
+ [Against The Elements](http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/ZX81/NewSoftware/AgainstTheElements.htm)

### WRX
+ Dr Beep's amazing collection of [81 1K games](https://www.sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=552&start=220)
  + A sub-set have been tested. More will be test tested, but it is very easy to become distracted as they are very addictive! So far all appear to be displayed correctly
+ [SplinterGU SInvaders](https://github.com/SplinterGU/SInvaders)
  + A very faithful clone of the arcade Space Invaders
+ [MaxDemo](https://bodo4all.fortunecity.ws/zx/maxdemo.html)
  + Hi-res 320x240 and 40 by 30 characters. Set `Centre` to off to see the full image.
  + The display routine is the most CPU intensive part of the emulator, so this is the best test that the emulator can run at 100% of the speed of "real" hardware
+ [HRDEMO3](https://www.zx81.nl/dload/utils/hrdemo3.p)
+ [HiRes Chess](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/32021/ZX81/Hi-res_Chess)
  + All 26 lines are shown
+ [Bi-Plot Demo](http://www.pictureviewerpro.com/hosting/zx81/download/zx81/fred/biplot.zip)
+ [Othello](https://www.sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?t=1220)
+ [WRX1K1](https://quix.us/timex/rigter/1khires.html)
  + The assembler routine runs in 1K, but the BASIC demo program that draws concentric circles does not, as it requires more than 1K of RAM. This can be verified by using the BASIC listing tool in EightyOne to check the memory address of each line of BASIC. It will run in 2K

+ [QS Asteroids](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/QSAsteroids) + [QS Scramble](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/QSScramble)

### Other UDG graphics
+ [Galaxians with sound and optionally user defined graphics](https://sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4388)

### Sound
+ [Pink Panther Demo](http://zx81.eu5.org/files/soft/toddy/pinkpthr.zip)
  + When configured for mono, channels A and B destructively interfere at around 2 mins 15 seconds, causing silence for 1 to 2 seconds. Selecting ACB stereo avoids this

  + Use `config.ini` in [`sounds`](examples/ZX81/Sounds/config.ini)
  + **Note:** The `config.ini` file must be in the same directory as the `.p` file, therefore to run the `splash.p` files supplied with the PT3 players, move them to the same directory as the player and ensure that a copy of the `config.ini` file is in that directory
  + The ZXpand configuration line in the PT3 player, which appears as a `LLIST` command at line 9992, should be deleted
### NTSC
+ [Nova2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20170309171559/http://www.user.dccnet.com/wrigter/index_files/NOVA2005.p)
  + This is written for a 60Hz ZX81. For the second count to be accurate the `NTSC` option must be enabled. If `NTSC` is not selected the clock will run at 50/60 speed. Nova generates up to 26 rows of 34 characters. These are displayed correctly
  + To see the clock when `NTSC` is *not* enabled, `Centre` must be set to Off. In this case a vsync bar will be seen at the bottom of the display
+ [Spirograph](http://www.pictureviewerpro.com/hosting/zx81/download/zx81/fred/spiro.zip)
    + For the `QUICK` display mode to function correctly the `NTSC` option must be enabled. Works correctly in `FAST` and `SLOW` mode regardless of the `NTSC` option

### Demos
These really show off the capabilities of the ZX81. Both should be viewed with `centre` set to `On`. Both generate images more than 320 pixels wide, so some information is not displayed

  + The scrolling "ticker" is more than 320 pixels wide, so all of it is not visible
+ [rezurrection](https://bodo4all.fortunecity.ws/zx/rezurrection.html)
  + The initial fast horizontal scrolling highlights the non-synchronised screen drawing of the emulator, leading to visible tearing

## ZX80

## Programs with limitations or artefacts
+ [QS Defenda](http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/QSDefenda)
  + This game generates 31 lines of text. As the emulator only displays 30 line of text, one can choose to display either the top or the bottom line. Set `Centre` to `off` to display the top line (which includes the score). The game is still playable without the bottom line being visible. The QS sound board is emulated correctly

# Developer Notes
## Use with an original ZX80/ZX81 keyboard
There are not enough unused GPIO pins on the Pimoroni demo boards to allow the direct connection of a ZX80/81 keyboard, but it can be done by using another Pico to convert the ZX80/81 keyboard into a USB keyboard. It may seem excessive to use a whole pico as a keyboard controller, but they are cheap and there is enough space to put the Pimoroni board, plus another Pico, plus a small USB hub into a ZX80 or ZX81 case

Code to convert a ZX8x keyboard to USB can be found at [ZX81_USB_KBD](https://github.com/ikjordan/ZX81_USB_KBD). This code has been used to successfully connect a ZX81 keyboard to this emulator. If the keyboard is the only peripheral, then it can be plugged straight into the USB port of the Pico on the emulator board with the power connected to the USB power socket of the Pimoroni board. If other USB peripherals (such as another keyboard, or a USB joystick) also need to be connected then the ZX80/81 keyboard can be connected via a USB hub

To access the function menus from a ZX80/81 keyboard enable the `doubleshift` configuration option

## Performance and constraints
The initial port from sz81 2.3.12 onto the Pico ran at approximately 10% of real time speed. Use of the Z80 emulator originally written for xz80 by Ian Collier, plus optimisation of the ZX81 memory access, display and plot routines allows the emulator to run at 100% of real time speed. The display of a full 320 by 240 image in real time (e.g. [MaxDemo](https://bodo4all.fortunecity.ws/zx/maxdemo.html)) uses approximately 90% of the available CPU clock cycles. An overclock to 250MHz is required

Corrections to the tstate timings were made for `ld a,n; ld c,n; ld e,n; ld l,n; set n,(hl); res n,(hl);`
## Possible Future Developments
+ Add volume control
+ Add vsync (TV) based sound
+ There are some interesting developments to extend PicoDVI to include audio over the HDMI signal
+ Use the contents of a string variable to supply a file name to the ZX80 load and save commands
+ Support for USB gamepads as well as joysticks
+ Extend the VGA322 board type to support original DB9 joysticks
+ Move to a Pi Zero to greatly increase processing power and use [circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle) for fast boot times

## Comparison to MCUME
[MCUME](https://github.com/Jean-MarcHarvengt/MCUME/) demonstrated that a Raspberry Pi Pico based ZX80/81 emulator was feasible. The custom VGA RGB 332 board type is similar to the hardware required for MCUME

This emulator offers the following over MCUME:
+ Support for USB keyboards and joysticks
+ Emulation runs at full speed of a 3.25MHz ZX81
+ Ability to save files
+ Ability to load a program without reset
+ Support for Hi-res and pseudo Hi-res graphics
+ Support for multiple DVI and VGA boards
+ Support for programs which use more than 32 columns or 24 rows of characters
+ ZonX and QS Sound emulation
+ Emulated QS UDG
+ 50Hz and 60Hz emulation
+ Emulator display refresh decoupled from Pico display rate
+ Mapping of joystick inputs to specific key presses
+ Hardware configuration associated with specific program files
+ Builds under Linux (MCUME ZX80/81 emulator fails to build in a case sensitive file system)
